Capturing and analyzing data with nmon
You can capture the data to a file for later analysis and graphing. Type the following command:
# nmon -f -s2 -c 30

OR
# nmon -ft -s 30 -c 120

nmon will run as a daemon in the background and you can log out. nmon will complete the data file capture and it will save in a file *.nmon file such as nas02_120806_0202.nmon. Where,

-f : Start data collect mode and output in spreadsheet format.
-s 2 : Wait between 2 seconds refreshing the screen.
-c30 : Total number of refreshes (30).
-t : Spreadsheet includes top processes.
-d disks : to increase the number of disks [default 256]
-x : Capacity planning (15 min for 1 day = -fdt -s 900 -c 96)
You need to download nmonanalyser which is an Excel spreadsheet that takes an output file from nmon and produces some nice graphs to aid in analysis and report writing.
